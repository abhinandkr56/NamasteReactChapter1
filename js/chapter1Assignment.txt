What is async and defer? - see my Youtube video ;)

Async => html parsing and fetching script runs parallely, but once the script fetch done, html parsing stops and then script executes and then html parsing continues.
Defer => html parsing and fetching script runs parallely, but even if the script fetch done, html parsing continues until it completes and then only script executes.

defer maintains the order of execution
async does not maintain order.
